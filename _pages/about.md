# Machine Learning Projects
## University Projects
### Hyphenation using deep neural networks
### Argumentation Mining with BERT
## NLP with BERT embeddings
Follow-up to my Master's thesis, I was interested in the possibilites of using pre-trained BERT networks in different applications.
### Machine Translation
### Sysnets
## CV projects
After I had started working in a Start-up focusing Computer Vision, my interest shifted to real-world problems of existing CV datasets and networks.
### Image augmentation
### Self-supervised learning
## Personalized Machine Learning
# As an artist
## Az első expedíció - My first published fiction novel
My first fiction novel takes place in the near future where humanity faces the challenges of contacting a new intelligent species. I wrote the original novel in the 10th grade of high school and revised it when I published it in 2018. The book is available in most major ebook stores thanks to PublishDrive's services.

## Parlement of Foules - Translation
One of my late high school projets is a Hungarian translation of *The Parlement of Foules* by Geoffrey Chaucer (1382). For this I used the original and the modern English translation of the poem.
Translating a 777 lines long mediaval English poem as a young Hungarian student - strugling with English at the time - has it's own challanges but I'm proud of the outcome to this day. [See the full translation here](http://george37.web.fazekas.hu/madar.html)
