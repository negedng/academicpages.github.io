This story shows a simple usage of the BERT [1] embedding using TensorFlow 2.0. As TensorFlow 2.0 has been released recently, the module aims to use easy, ready-to-use models based on the high-level Keras API. The previous usage of BERT was described in a long Notebook implementing a Movie Review prediction. In this story, we will see a simple BERT embedding generator using Keras and the latest TensorFlow and TensorFlow Hub modules. All codes are available on Google Colab.
